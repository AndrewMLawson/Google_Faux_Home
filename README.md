# Google Faux HomePage Project

## Objective
The goal of this project was to practice some basic HTML and CSS skills by recreating the Google home page. 
My rendition is currently missing some icons, but besides that, it looks pretty similar.

## Skills Practiced
The skills I had to use to complete this project were:
- FlexBox for positioning of elements.
- General CSS formatting and the use of various selectors
- HTML page creation
- Use of Live Server
- Git and Github to track progress and changes
